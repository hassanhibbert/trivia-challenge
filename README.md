# Trivia Challenge - (Angular Quiz App)

Trivia Challenge is a single page app that I developed in AngularJS. I originally built this project using jQuery but months later decided to revisit this project and rebuild everything in AngularJS. In this project I built a custom “quiz-timer” directive to handle the time remaining to complete the quiz. I also include some configurable options into this directive to set the time limit from the DOM element itself, as well as an option that disables the timer once the quiz is submitted.

To handle the logic and data management for the quiz I created services that I could later inject into my controllers to handle updating the view with additional information. Rebuilding this quiz app in angular definitely helped with handling multiple routes. Instead of just displaying what score the user got on the quiz, I was able to easily add another page/route to review the questions the user got right or wrong.
